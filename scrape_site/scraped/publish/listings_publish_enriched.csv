The Void Space is a single four-storey unit of over 30 ft in height and 65 ft in length, with a wonderful structural composition of varying exposed concrete finishes. A superb design developed by renowned architectural practices, 6a Architects and Sanchez Benton Architects, has achieved planning permission for a home approaching 3,100 sq ft, arranged along one side of a dramatic quadruple height space in a series of refined steel and glass-framed galleries.  The Building  Cromwell is one of three towers within the Barbican estate, along with Shakespeare and Lauderdale. Built in 1973 as part of Phase III of the City’s bold and ambitious building programme for the site, it is the eastern-most of the original towers, resting at the junction of Beech Street and Silk Street, near the Arts Centre, the Conservatory (at Podium level) and is the closest of the three to Moorgate.  The site itself occupies four levels at the base of Cromwell Tower, bounded to the south by Silk Street and, to the west, by the Barbican Upper Podium level, with a four-storey frontage to the south and two-storey frontage to the west. The latter façade, looking out onto the Podium at the upper level, is fully glazed and enjoys views over Nigel Dunnett’s award-winning planting scheme for the Barbican High Walk.  The Architects  In 1951 the City of London ran a competition for architects to submit plans for a scheme to replace buildings destroyed by a night of bombing in December 1940. The proposal was to be called the Golden Lane Estate. Peter Chamberlin, Geoffrey Powell and Christoph Bon all submitted plans and agreed that if one of their practices won, they would form a partnership and work together on the project. Powell won the competition, and thus Chamberlin, Powell & Bon was formed in 1952. After their success with the Golden Lane Estate, the firm was asked to design the Barbican Estate, now arguably London’s most iconic brutalist complex. For more information about The Barbican, please see the History section.  The design for The Void Space at Cromwell Tower has been developed by 6a architects who have a deserved reputation for creating award-winning architecture within existing buildings of significant heritage value and for running what has become an increasingly international practice. Architects Carlos Sanchez and Tom Benton met while working at 6a architects from 2010 to 2017 and established Sanchez Benton Architects in 2017. Sanchez And Benton continue to have a close working relationship with 6a Architects and were selected by their client to act as collaborators on envisioning occupation of The Void Space design as presented in the renders appearing here.  The Tour  Currently, access to the site is via the Silk Street frontage, a few steps above the surrounding street level. The design proposes to reimagine the Silk Street entrance through the introduction of an elegantly planted entry platform. Additionally, the design accommodates the opportunity to create access via the main foyer entrance of Cromwell Tower, which provides the amenity of 24-hour porterage.  The primary structural and material expression of The Void Space is exposed concrete, punctuated by expansive areas of robustly detailed steel-framed glazing. On the longer, lower levels, the concrete has a moderately fair-faced finish; on the Podium level and above, the concrete has a finely honed bush-hammered surface. The rich texture of the concrete and rhythmic sequence of the glazing set a dramatic and monumental backdrop against which the refined and elegant delicacy of the residential occupation will play out.  The proposed design takes the form of three ‘shelves’ stacked vertically along the length of the void to create long, elegant living spaces. Rising in the void, these spaces are connected by a steel stair, simple in concept and form but spanning an extraordinary distance and scale, rare for a residential setting. Correspondingly, the design embodies a vertical hierarchy strongly akin to the formal arrangement of a London townhouse; the more public spaces of the home will be arranged on the lower levels, and the more intimate spaces will be set out across the upper floors.  The kitchen will be placed at ground level, where cooking, pantry and utility areas are to be set beneath the first-floor level, with dining and socialising spilling out into the volume of the void. A living room, library and guest WC will span the first-floor level, and this floor will provide the opportunity for access to the mezzanine lobby of Cromwell Tower.  Two rooms will occupy the second floor. These could be arranged as two bedrooms or as a bedroom and study, depending on needs. A bathroom will be positioned between them. The main bedroom suite is proposed for the third floor, spanning the entire length of the shell, allowing for an elegant sequence of reposing, sleeping, dressing and bathing spaces.  Outdoor Space  As the Barbican’s name indicates, one of the principal intents of the original master plan was to provide an enclosed sanctuary for the Estate’s residents. Within the Barbican, both public and private outdoor spaces are concentrated centrally, and residents have access to a number of both private and public gardens within the enclosure of The Estate.  The principal private gardens extend to approximately two and a half acres and are sited at the Eastern and Western ends of the Barbican lake, which itself extends to over one and a half acres. These gardens are laid out in a naturalistic manner with expansive lawns, punctuated by the cover of foliage from various species of mature trees and surrounded by rich and textural borders planted with both native and exotic species. This whole ensemble makes for a tranquil and secluded retreat within the heart of the city, and this resource is often seen as one of the most unexpected but cherished aspects of life in the Barbican.  There are dedicated areas for children’s play along with a variety of architectural follies, including a brutalist waterfall and a sunken garden and seating area, which is set within the lake.  The Area  The Barbican has a wealth of public facilities available to residents within the Arts Centre, with its theatre, art gallery,  concert venue, cinemas, and several bars and cafes. The City of London has recently appointed Allies and Morrison. Architects and Asif Khan Studio to deliver a multi-million-pound renewal of the Barbican Centre. The Centre forms is a key part of ‘Culture Mile’, the City of London’s cultural district, which stretches from Farringdon to Moorgate. The ‘Cultural Mile’ includes the Guildhall School of Music & Drama, the London Symphony Orchestra and the Museum of London. It provides a vibrant and creative area with a diverse and international cultural program of concerts, events, and performances.  The apartment is near an excellent selection of pubs and restaurants, including the nearby Smithfield Market, St. John, Luca, The Quality Chop House, and the Exmouth Market. Whitecross Street also has a food market every weekday. St Paul’s, the River Thames, the South Bank and Tate Modern are all close by.  Transport links are excellent, with Underground stations at nearby Barbican (Circle, Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan Lines), Old Street (Northern Line), Farringdon (Circle, Hammersmith & City, and Metropolitan Lines, plus Thameslink services to Gatwick Airport, Brighton and Bedford) and Moorgate (Northern, Hammersmith & City, Circle and Metropolitan Lines). The Elizabeth Line has recently commenced service from Farringdon. This station now offers high-speed transit across the East-West axis of London, extending out to Heathrow (with a direct service from Farringdon to Heathrow scheduled to start in Spring 2023).  Tenure: Leasehold Lease Length: approx. 85 years remaining Ground Rent: approx. £10 per annum Service Charge: approx. £10,000 per annum Council Tax Band: G"

The area is a settled, neighbourly community with a plethora of amenities on hand. Superb Schooling is standard within Sutton and this house has Harris academy and Seaton House within a short walk, transport is easy with local buses linking local town centres and train stations linking Central London with easy distances, although it’s the features such as Royal Marsden and the entrance to Banstead Downs that are slightly more unique.    From every angle this house holds a powerful handsome gaze. The garden envelopes the property and wraps around giving multiple dimensions whilst the large driveway beckons you in. To the side of the property, the double detached garage is an ideal storage solution or special parking facility. Internally, the property has three bedrooms, two reception rooms, kitchen, family bathroom and separate W.C. Its right to point out that the property has bags of character and is easy to live in, due to its size its best suited to small families, couples and down sizers.

The rear portion of the garden faces south ensuring a very sunny disposition. The plot measures just over .22 of an acre.    Quite simply we implore you to view ASAP.

There’s also a night bus back from Morden tube for any late nights in town.   Carshalton has a friendly, quintessential village feel and we’ve loved exploring the many local pubs (The Sun and The Greyhound are our favourites), herring spotting at the ponds (complete with a cute tea and scones spot), quirky independent shops, the several parks in the area, the small biodiversity nature reserve, golf, activity centre with rock climbing, gym, swimming pool, and of course the famous lavender fields nearby. The flat itself is full of character, which is why we fell in love with it - it has good bones! We’ve just added a new hob and oven and it’s had a fresh paint and new carpet. We’ve found having a cellar really handy for storage and have loved having an outdoor space to sit in. Tenure: Shared Freehold Council Tax: B Lease Remaining: 999 Current ground rent: £0.00 Per Year Ground rent review period: every 12 years Annual ground rent increase: 2%"

With Shared Ownership, you buy a share of your home using a mortgage from a bank or building society and pay a subsidised rent on the share you did not purchase. The combined mortgage and rent is usually less than you'd expect to pay if you bought a similar property outright. At New Mill Quarter  you can buy a minimum 50% share of your home (the maximum you can buy initially is 75%). When you're ready, you can buy more shares until you staircase to owning 100% of your home. These apartments will appeal to professionals working locally and those commuting into London."

When we came to view this flat, all the blinds were down and it was completely dark outside. It felt like the shell of a place and I have to admit I wasn’t that impressed. I wasn’t convinced but everyone else seemed to be, so not long after we moved in. It did not take me long at all to realise how wrong my initial feelings had been. Things that were not immediately obvious at the first viewings quickly became apparent as we settled into our new place: The quiet days and quieter nights as a result of being away from main roads and tucked into a sheltered pocket of houses. The loft that we have packed to the rafters with the many possessions and paraphernalia we have accumulated over the years. The open plan living area is wonderfully social but also perfectly hides the washing up for you to ignore till your guests have departed. The shops are just a short walk away and a moment’s drive for the inevitable forgotten ingredient, as well as a corner shop even closer for our embarrassingly regular ASOS returns. There is also the feeling that this is more of a maisonette than a flat being that we are the only ones on our floor and enjoy the privacy of being the only ones to travel our flight of stairs. Sunlight streams in through the kitchen and living room to welcome you in the morning and warm the bedrooms with a beautiful glow by the afternoon. Over one of the lockdowns (I’ve lost track of which one), I gave the kitchen a facelift by fitting a new sink, making new cabinet doors and covering the worktop. The flat is a fun space to put your stamp on; I have certainly enjoyed making it our own over the years. There is ample parking, fantastic transport links, wonderful neighbours, open views from both sides of the flat and well kept communal gardens can also be added to the long but non-exhaustive list of things we love about this flat. For the kids, there are many playgrounds dotted in walking distance which have quickly become part of our daily routine with our energetic little boy. We are also nearby the river which we had completely overlooked until it became my favourite route to walk along during my first pregnancy and throughout the years that have followed. If we could magically add another bedroom and a garden we would. With another baby on the way, my husband now working from home more regularly and a son who needs all the space we can provide him, it is sadly time for us to move on"".

The Shared Ownership scheme is a Part Buy, Part Rent way of owning your own home for a smaller up front payment. With Shared Ownership, you buy a share of your home using a mortgage from a bank or building society and pay a subsidised rent on the share you did not purchase.

At New Mill Quarter  you can buy a minimum 50% share of your home (the maximum you can buy initially is 75%). When you're ready, you can buy more shares until you staircase to owning 100% of your home. These apartments will appeal to professionals working locally and those commuting into London."

This property is great for a first time buyer and also offers excellent return on investment. Some Words From The Owner: What do you love most about your home? I love the views, looking out to the greenery of south London, and getting to witness a different beautiful sunset every evening. It's very peaceful up here. The estate has also just started up a community garden where vegetables and flowers are being grown.  Why are you moving? I started working from home during the pandemic and my business is expanding, I'd like to be able to upsize so I can see clients at home rather than rent a studio.  What do you love about the area? Being right on the edge of Wandsworth common is amazing, the fact that I can walk right out and be in the greenery is something I love. The area feels very safe and has a friendly slower paced feel to other parts of south London. The transport links to Clapham junction and Tooting Bec are also really easy (I walk to Clapham junction in 15 minutes) meaning getting into town takes no time."

Shared Ownership is a Government-backed scheme for first-time buyers who are unable to afford a suitable home at the full market price. You initially purchase between 25-75% of the home's market value. You then pay subsidised rent on the remainder calculated at 2.75% per annum. Am I eligible? To be considered eligible for the Shared Ownership scheme your yearly income must be below £80,000. For London the limit is £90,000. Those who already own a home are not eligible for the scheme. You would need to sell your current home to be considered Will I need to pay a deposit? In terms of a deposit you will need 5% of the percentage of the home you're purchasing. Kitchens come with fully integrated appliances, designer units and stone worktops. Bath and shower rooms offer oak veneered alcoves, porcelain tiled floors and walls and chrome- plated fixings. Bedrooms feature floor-to-ceiling fitted wardrobes, brushed metal sockets and subtle  light grey carpets. All apartments at The Switch are offered on the  Shared Ownership scheme, making them ideal for  first-time buyers.

It was bliss for us, living at the time on a busy main road. When we came through the door, we both liked the spacious feel of the entrance, the high ceilings in the bedrooms and the abundance of natural light the property has (even then with a galley kitchen!). The large garden and detached double garage were the icings on the cake and in 2004 we became the proud owners. The property borders 3 local councils with excellent transport links from Mitcham Eastfields, Streatham Common and Norbury, making getting to Central London so easy. Buses and the Tram make getting to Croydon or Mitcham Town Centre a quick commute. Mitcham Common is our best-kept secret and we have enjoyed exploring it on foot and cycle rides. We are now 16 years on... with walls removed, new walls created, an open plan integrated kitchen put in and French doors to the garden. We also have a paved patio area to sit and enjoy a cup of tea. We have enjoyed our home and wish we could transport our home to South Hams, but alas that is not possible so we will take with us instead, all our beautiful memories from ""Sunny"" (nicknamed such because of the natural light throughout the property).

I had been looking for a while and had not seen such a great space! It felt and still feels incredibly homely. It is neatly tucked away in the corner, so it is incredibly quiet, which is an added bonus. I particularly loved how I had my own front door, as it meant I had my own private entrance, something which was really unique to this flat. I have recently renovated the flat to a modern standard, which adds to allowing it to feel like a home, instead of just a house. Each room is a fantastic size! The bedroom can fit a double bed in, and I have also added a desk which is useful on the days I work from home. The bedroom also has a built-in wardrobe which is huge! I have had the added bonus of having an incredibly generously sized garden, which is the perfect space for children to play in, or for having friends and family over in the summer months. There is also, of course, scope to extend the flat too. Visitors are always impressed at the size of the living room, and the fact that I have a separate kitchen as well! With an integrated fridge/freezer, oven and microwave, you could easily feel at home from the moment you move in. This property also is fortunate to have a private garage space, what more could you really ask for? Well, there is more! Being 30 seconds to a minute walk away from bus stops that can take you to local areas around such as Streatham and Croydon, in as little as 15 minutes is definitely an added bonus. The flat is also close to three Zone 3 train stations which can take you into Central London in as little as 15 minutes. If you are a driver there is plenty of free parking around, as well as the garage space. There is also a range of local shops within a two-minute walk, which has been useful when I’ve forgotten the crucial ingredient or item off of my shopping list! Buying this property was undoubtedly the best decision I have made. I have lived here for two and a half years, and after much deliberation, I have decided to move on to be closer to family.""

Contextually driven in response to an unusually shaped site, the design is inspired by the nautical layout of a boat, with beautifully light open-plan living areas ‘floating above the sea-level gardens like elevated decks’ and more intimate sleeping areas set in the lower levels. Internal living space of over 1,915 sq ft extends across three storeys, with full-height glass walls framing verdant views across the treetops. Private enclosed gardens extend to the front and a carport is set beneath the cantilever.  The Architect  Andrei Saltykov studied at the Moscow Architectural Institute and Bartlett School of Architecture. He was awarded the prestigious Queen’s Award and became a Chevening Scholar. In the following years, he lived in the UK and USA working as an Associate for Richard Rogers Partnership and as an Associate Partner for Foster + Partners. In 2011 he co-founded his own practice, Lacey+Saltykov Architects.  The Tour  Approached via a quiet residential road, the two houses sit side by side on the corner plot, where a defining angular profile of charcoal grey draws a striking impression against the skyline. Construction is of prefabricated timber panels, with wall insulation made of shredded paper injected into the panels through circular holes. A water-based heating network runs underfoot.  A gated walkway leads through enclosed front gardens, primarily laid to lawn and bordered by mature hedging. The primary entrance is neatly enclosed in the front façade and accessed via a set of external steps, which in turn opens into a bright hallway with a cloakroom set to one side and storage concealed within bespoke cabinetry.  The primary living spaces are organised in an open plan across the upper-ground floor. The living and dining areas are positioned on the south-easterly aspect, where the natural light is exceptional. A floor-to-ceiling glass wall frames verdant views across the treetops, and the park beyond. Solid timber flooring runs underfoot with pleasing aesthetic continuity. A fireplace partition neatly divides the living and kitchen areas, retaining an impressive sense of open space and volume.  At one side of the room, a cleverly conceived modern kitchen is defined by clean lines of cabinetry, partially free-standing and partially built into the stairwell. Every inch of space has been carefully considered to create an intimate area for cooking, adapting with ease from a sociable entertaining layout to a space that can accommodate the daily practicalities of family life.  A glass panel sensitively screens the timber-tread stairwell, which leads to the main bedroom suite and a fantastic additional living space on the upper storey. Currently set out as a home office, this is a quiet and peaceful space with ample space for two desks, and would equally well suit an additional bedroom. Full-height glazing optimises the wonderfully green backdrop, and a free-standing bathtub has been strategically placed to optimise the dramatic views.  The main bedroom is located on the north side of this level and is another restful room with a generous provision of storage. An en suite bathroom is positioned centrally, with a skylight overhead, allowing light to stream down into the shower.  The additional three bedrooms are positioned on the lower-ground floor, one of which has an ensuite.The other two bedrooms are served by a family bathroom. The integral garage can also be accessed from this level, with additional storage space and utilities and an electric up-and-over door leading to the cantilevered carport. In total, there are three private parking spaces; two beneath the car port and one space in the garage.  Outdoor Space  The front gardens have been beautifully landscaped while retaining an ease of maintenance and upkeep. A wide expanse of lawn is bordered by mature hedging and fencing to ensure excellent privacy, and there are several areas for eating and relaxing in warmer months.  The Area  Neighbouring Wimbledon is one of London’s most attractive areas, with its large, open green space of Wimbledon Park and The All England Tennis Club, a 20-minute walk away. An excellent selection of independent restaurants, cafés and boutiques in Wimbledon Village can also be easily reached on foot. The New Wimbledon Theatre, one of London’s largest Edwardian theatres, is a 15-minute train journey. The new AFC Wimbledon football stadium on Plough Lane is also within walking distance.  Tooting Broadway and Tooting Market are a 10-minute journey by bus. The red-and-white fronted covered Tooting market has been there for 80 years and is open daily. While it still offers the local community a place for their weekly shop for staples (butcher, baker), it’s also a hub of great eateries, where you can find Venezuelan arepas, ramen or Guyanese dhal pouri with fluffy roti, served out of hatches or permanent restaurants.  The house also sits within catchment for a number of excellent schools, including Wimbledon Park Primary School (Ofsted Outstanding).  There are excellent transport links, with Wimbledon Park (District line) and Earlsfield (Mainline) a five-minute walk away. There is also easy access around Wimbledon via car, as it borders the A3.  Council Tax Band: G"

The design is contextually driven in response to an unusually shaped site. Although independent of each other, there is great potential to join the two houses from the primary living areas. Internal living space of over 1,200 sq ft spans two storeys, with ribbons of carefully-positioned glazing framing verdant views and inviting an excellent quality of natural light and private enclosed gardens extend to the front of the house.  The Architect  Andrei Saltykov studied at the Moscow Architectural Institute and Bartlett School of Architecture. He was awarded the prestigious Queen’s Award and became a Chevening Scholar. In the following years, he lived in the UK and USA working as an Associate for Richard Rogers Partnership and as an Associate Partner for Foster + Partners. In 2011, he co-founded his own practice, Lacey+Saltykov Architects.  The Tour  Approached via a quiet residential road, the two houses sit side by side on the corner plot, where the defining angular profile in charcoal grey draws a striking impression against the skyline. Construction of both houses is of prefabricated timber panels, with wall insulation made of shredded paper injected into the panels through circular holes and a water-based underfloor heating network.  A shingle walkway leads through the enclosed front gardens to the primary entrance, set neatly within the façade of the house. The bright entrance hall at ground level, in turn, opens onto a timber-tread stairwell leading up to the primary living areas across the upper floor.  The layout is inspired by the nautical design of a boat, with beautifully light open-plan living areas ‘floating above the sea-level gardens like elevated decks’ and more intimate sleeping areas set on the lower levels.  The living, dining and kitchen spaces are characterised by clean lines and an excellent quality of natural light, which streams in through expansive skylights and carefully positioned vertical ribbons of glazing. Timber flooring runs underfoot with pleasing aesthetic continuity.  A fireplace, flanked by bookshelves, forms a natural focal point at one side, while low lines of bespoke cabinetry create neat divisions and provide additional storage.  The cleverly conceived modern kitchen is set on the northerly side of the plan, with bespoke cabinetry set into the wall creating an intimate, practical area for cooking while optimising every inch of space. The dining area is positioned adjacently.  The three bedrooms, positioned on the lower-ground floor level, are wonderfully quiet and peaceful. Each has large picture windows inviting a good level of natural light and framing leafy views of the gardens. The main bedroom, on the southerly side of the plan, has an en suite shower room. The additional two bedrooms are served by a family bathroom with a shower and a bathtub. The services and laundry facilities are housed in a large utility room, also on this level.  Outdoor Space  The front gardens have been beautifully landscaped while retaining an ease of maintenance and upkeep; primarily laid to lawn with mature hedging and fencing to ensure excellent privacy, and a side border for growing herbaceous plants throughout the seasons.  The Area  Neighbouring Wimbledon is one of London’s most attractive areas, with its large, open green space of Wimbledon Park and The All England Tennis Club, a 20-minute walk away. An excellent selection of independent restaurants, cafés and boutiques in Wimbledon Village can also be easily reached on foot. The New Wimbledon Theatre, one of London’s largest Edwardian theatres, is a 15-minute train journey. The new AFC Wimbledon football stadium on Plough Lane is also within walking distance.  Tooting Broadway and Tooting Market are a 10-minute journey by bus. The red-and-white fronted covered Tooting market has been there for 80 years and is open daily. While it still offers the local community a place for their weekly shop for staples (butcher, baker), it’s also a hub of great eateries, where you can find Venezuelan arepas, ramen or Guyanese dhal pouri with fluffy roti, served out of hatches or permanent restaurants.  The house also sits within catchment for a number of excellent schools, including Wimbledon Park Primary School (Ofsted Outstanding).  There are excellent transport links, with Wimbledon Park (District line) and Earlsfield (Mainline) a five-minute walk away. There is also easy access around Wimbledon via car, as it borders the A3.  Council Tax Band: F"

Once at the top of the stairs you will see a peak into the master bedroom. This is where the magic happens, and of course by magic we mean sleeping. It feels like magic when you get more than 6 hours right? Also in the bedroom there is a big bay window for natural light, great for those selfie takers among us.  Ok, let's not pretend that this flat is close to the A3 and sometimes you might get a little hum of a passing Ferrari but the good double glazed windows work well to block out all the unwanted noise. The second bedroom is just nearby, it's the perfect size for a nursery and right next door you don't have to worry about your little ones in the night. And if you're not quite ready for little ones then this is your office/place to stash your overnight guests. Just opposite the second bedroom is a family bathroom. Displaying a new modern suite, it's a good place to clean up after a messy day. Moving on to the reception/living room, if you need a place to unwind in the evenings, you've found your spot. There is room for two double sized sofas and even possibly another arm chair if you are expecting guests.  With a kitchen large enough for a decent table you get to choose where you have your morning coffee. There's no feeling of being cramped here with the doors to the garden and being connected to the living room.  You don't have to worry about those spilt cups of tea, the tea towel will be there in seconds to wipe it up. The cream coloured modern shelving give the room a bright and airy feel as you look out into your garden. If we've learnt anything the last few years, it's that we all value having a garden. On Huntley Way you could have your own private South West facing plot with plenty of room for all your gardening tools and very important swing sets. There is also access to a loft which has plenty of space for hiding all your Christmas decorations and embarrassing senior school photographs. If of course you don't have any embarrassing school photos there is a potential to extend (subject to the freeholder and planning consent).

The property is being sold with a freehold tenure. Overview Nestled between the sprawling greenery of Wimbledon Common and the lush formal gardens of Cannizaro Park is Lordell Place. The property is part of an exclusive cluster of homes that sit within a private cul de sac, offering a quiet escape from the city. All while remaining in close reach of commuting opportunities, as Central London is a 25-minute journey from the property.  Sitting on the former grounds of Chester House, Lordell Place has the unique benefit of being of newer construction, meaning extensive remedial works to bring the home up to modern standard are not required as would be the case with an older property. By the same token, Lordell Place retains a sense of historic charm that is often lost in modern architecture, therefore offering the new owners the best of both worlds. Its construction was also met with several awards upon completion, including the Evening Standard Best Development Award and the Green Leaf Award. Giving a grand first impression of the property is the entrance hall, with the additional option of entering the home through the double garage. Several rooms lead off from this most welcoming of entrance spaces. Most notably, the reception room creates the feeling of an infinite amount of living space as it features an intuitive open plan layout connecting it with the rear dining room. Fused by the clean and bright decor that features throughout, a generous use of skylights maximises the amount of natural light the space receives, ensuring year-round enjoyment of the key living areas of the home.  Moving through to the kitchen, which features modern built-in cabinets and appliances, creating a neat and practical environment. As a central hub of the home, the kitchen is easily accessible from all other living and dining spaces. Elsewhere on the ground floor is a study, a utility room and a downstairs bathroom. Heading upstairs where the first of the property’s four bedrooms, the master suite, can be found. Accompanied by fitted wardrobes and an en-suite bathroom, enchanting views over the garden create a peaceful ambiance. The additional three bedrooms have been cleanly finished with fresh plastering and a neutral colour scheme, ensuring the new owners can easily make the space their own. A separate family bathroom also serves the additional three bedrooms and features a bath and a shower facility.  Shrouded by mature trees offering an optimum amount of privacy, the rear garden creates a tranquil spot that is abundant in usage potential. The garden is also popular with local wildlife, in particular a set of badgers that frequent the area. The front communal garden areas also come with a management company which include all responsibility for landscaping and general maintenance.  In summary, for any property hunters in search of a solid family home offering an abundance of living space while remaining in close reach of the city of London, arranging a viewing of Lordell Place should be a top consideration.  Location Wimbledon is located within the London borough of Merton, which along with nearby Richmond, is routinely voted as one of the safest areas to live in London. Recent data also suggests that crime in Wimbledon has fallen to its lowest levels in over five years, making it easy to see why the area is particularly attractive to families who relocate here. Likewise, the area is popular with working professionals and retirees alike due to its relaxed pace of life.  A number of schools and colleges lie within the catchment area of the property. Over 30 of which have been rated as ‘Outstanding’ by Ofsted, including Ursuline High School, Dundonald Primary School, Wimbledon Chase Primary School and Merton Park Primary School.  The world-famous Wimbledon tennis tournament doesn’t just create a buzz in the town every year but also opens up the potential for short term lets in the area, which can be a particularly lucrative opportunity for homeowners.  Wimbledon Village is only a 10-minute stroll from the property and is packed with a plethora of boutique shops and restaurants that instantly give the feel of quaint country life. Cinemas, theatres and even an interesting mix of museums can also be found here. Residents enjoy an abundance of green spaces on their doorstep in Wimbledon, with Wimbledon Common, Richmond Park, Bushy Park, Morden Park and Mitcham Common all close by. In addition, the area has a number of gyms and health clubs.  Transport Lordell Place is extremely well connected via public transport options, as well as being close to several arterial road networks. The property is 0.5 miles from the A219, which continues north towards Chelsea. Other major roads, including A3 and A24, are also within a short drive, connecting with Central London as well as the wider South East.  Wimbledon Tube Station (District Line) is 1.4 miles from the property. The Circle Line, Piccadilly Line, Central Line, Victoria Line, and London Overground services are all within a short commutable distance.  The tube station also connects with Wimbledon Train Station, offering frequent direct services to London Waterloo, Richmond, St Albans, Woking, Hampton Court, Sutton, Shepperton, Guildford and Dorking.

It has all the convenience of being in London but looks onto a quiet branch of the river Wandle, with its tree-lined banks and wildlife (seeing cranes - in bird form - used to be a rarity!). Merton Abbey Mills is a must. The restaurants and entertainment are so unknown it's a hidden gem. Everything's at our fingertips: If we forget something in the weekly shop or need to get some dinner, Sainsbury's and M&S are on the way home or just a 5 minute walk away. It's easy to get into central / across London on the Northern line, and there's no need to keep an eye on first or last trains at the weekends.

I’ve lived in this house since 2006 and throughout that time it’s shown me its versatility and adaptability. I moved in as a single first-time buyer and had more space than I knew how to handle as it is deceivingly spacious. The large bedroom at the front was my reception room, the now living room was the dining room and the third bedroom was my study. Now with many years passed, a child and a partner in addition it has taken on a whole new form and still feels spacious. This place really can accommodate a wide range of people with different needs and you still have the option to extend into the loft area. We’re moving as it’ll be our first property together and with future plans, a lot more space will be required. We won’t be going too far though as this area really is ideal. The west-facing garden means that in the summer the majority of the sun is directly in the garden till sunset. You can really enjoy the summer months with the space and privacy it provides as well as getting the BBQ going without any smoke going into the house. Living so close to the station is something I’ll forever miss once we move. It is 20 minutes direct to London Victoria & 28 minutes to London Blackfriars and with a short walk to the departing platform it really doesn’t get any better. You are also only 8 minutes and 1 stop away from Balham; perfect for the Northern line or to enjoy what Balham itself has to offer. Convenience really couldn’t be any better: LIDL (take your pick there’s 4 close by), Morrison’s and ASDA are all within a short walking distance along with the local newsagents right at the bottom of the road. You also have the Tandem Centre in nearby Colliers Wood should you fancy a Nando’s or require anything from Argos, Dunelm or Curry’s, it's only a 5-minute drive or 15 minutes on the 152 bus. You really are in the centre of it all without having the noise and congestion to deal with. Lastly, but not least, we have Figges Marsh or Mitcham Common which has perfect open green spaces for a walk or a run. There’s also a wide range of local gyms (Kings, Nuffield, The Gym or Better Gym) should you require the use of such establishments.""
