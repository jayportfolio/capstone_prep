 About Shared Ownership 
 
 Now that you have found your dream property you're probably asking, ""is Shared Ownership right for me?"" At Optivo, we know that a new home is one of the biggest purchases you will ever make, and Shared Ownership helps make this a reality.
 
 You'll start by buying a share in your property that's between 25% and 75% of the full value, using a combination of a mortgage and a deposit. You will then pay a subsidised rent on the share you don't buy.
 
 In the future, if your circumstances change and you'd like to, you can purchase more shares in your home, right up to 100%. As your share increases, the rent you pay decreases.

It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet, or PC, maybe by sending out a random email that mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine. The reason for us mentioning this to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g. just before the exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears. Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond the property. Solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information. The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991 These particulars are set out as a general outline in accordance with the Property Misdescriptions Act (1991) only for the guidance of intending purchasers or lessees and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract.

Gardens, roof terraces, balconies as well as tenure and lease details cannot have their accuracy guaranteed for intending purchasers.

Waltham Forest's residents and businesses stand to benefit significantly from the economic growth taking place across London.

In the last five years the number of jobs in the borough has increased by 30 per cent (the highest in London) and the number of businesses by 40 per cent (the sixth highest increase in London).

Parkleys was the first project by SPAN co-founders Eric Lyons and Geoff Townsend and is one of London’s finest residential modernist estates. It is set among beautiful communal gardens planted with flowering trees, and expansive stretches of lawn that are much loved by residents. The estate is located in leafy Ham, a pretty suburb with a lovely high street, which sits between Richmond Park and the River Thames in south London.  The Architect  SPAN are perhaps the most celebrated of all 20th-century British residential developers. Many of the developments that they worked on throughout the south of England are now listed, and they are renowned for their outstanding, yet simple, modern architectural style and their considered landscaping. For more information, please see the History section below.  The Tour  The apartment is on the second floor of Herrick Court. Entry is to a short hallway, with plenty of storage, leading through to the main living spaces. Full width wooden framed windows stretch across the living room offering a panorama of the luscious treetops that ensconce the estate. The current owners have reinstated certain SPAN features, including a beautiful glass partition between the kitchen and living space, and the tiled hearth surrounding the newly installed wood burning stove. Engineered oak floorboards run throughout the apartment and all the windows have been fitted with English Heritage double glazing.  The kitchen sits at the back of the plan overlooking the communal gardens. Ply cabinetry is finished with a Corian worktop and a white tiled splashback, establishing a fresh and contemporary feel. Bespoke shelving lines the left-hand wall above the dining area maximising storage space.  An archway leads through to the bedrooms and bathrooms framed by a beautifully crafted wooden surround; a hallmark of the attention to detail exercised throughout the apartment. The main bedroom sits at the front of the plan with treetop views. Original built-in wardrobes and corner shelving provide plenty of storage in this generously proportioned room.  The second bedroom has a dual aspect, its windows wrapping round the corner of the building, the immediacy of the gardens and tree tops never out of view. The adjacent bathroom has a cream rubber floor, Johnson tiles, and Lusso matt black fixtures and fittings. This is a sympathetic update to the SPAN aesthetic. There is a deep corner cupboard at the end of the hallway.  The communal areas and landing are of particular note in this estate; they have been impeccably executed with decorative brick, glass and bespoke SPAN details that have been lovingly maintained. Each apartment has a private external store and there are communal drying and bike storage rooms.  Outdoor space  Parkleys, like many SPAN schemes, is renowned for its expansive communal gardens that wrap around the estate. Mature flowering trees give the area a woodland feel whilst the lawns give all resident access to generous outdoor space.  The Area  Ham is a picturesque district in southwest London located between Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames. It unfurls around a large, open common and is renowned for the quality of its period architecture, the most notable example of which is Ham House, described by the National Trust as “the most complete survival of 17th-century fashion and power”.  Ham Common woods nature reserve is a five minute walk away and runs towards the expanse of Richmond Park beyond. There is a parade of shops in Ham, including a monthly farmers’ market plus wider shopping and dining opportunities in Richmond and Kingston.  Richmond and Kingston both have fast train connections into central London.  Tenure: Share of Freehold Lease Length: approx. 959 years remaining Service Charge: approx. £2,400 per annum Parking: There is unallocated residents parking in the estate Council Tax Band: D"

Each property features rare high ceilings and generous, flexible layouts made with materials and components that delight all the senses.  All the apartments benefit from tremendously generous proportions, large window sizes and private external spaces.
