At Optivo, we know that a new home is one of the biggest purchases you will ever make, and Shared Ownership helps make this a reality.  You'll start by buying a share in your property that's between 25% and 75% of the full value, using a combination of a mortgage and a deposit. You will then pay a subsidised rent on the share you don't buy.  In the future, if your circumstances change and you'd like to, you can purchase more shares in your home, right up to 100%. As your share increases, the rent you pay decreases.  Speak to a member of our sales team for more details using the contact details below. Brochures Brochure 1",2022-06-26 17:39:35

Set over four levels, with a terrace shaded by mature trees on the upper ground floor and a courtyard garden below, the house has been carefully extended and renovated using a considered palette of neutral colours and natural textures that engender a serene sense of openness within the period spaces.  The Building  This pretty row of houses speaks to the industrial history of Hackney Wick and is a rare ‘heritage asset’ in an area now known for its diverse built environment, exciting food scene, artist’s community and coveted parks and marshland. The house’s smart façade is set with a neat bay window that is engulfed in sweet-smelling wisteria and belies the decidedly contemporary treatment of the interior spaces. The house is crowned with a new Welsh slate roof that conceals the loft extension.  The Tour  Entry is to the raised ground floor, where the current owners have created an incredibly bright open-plan kitchen and dining space. Double doors at the rear, and the south-facing windows at the front, ensure that the space is filled with light throughout the day. The walls here have the soft hue of bare plaster, and Bauwerk’s ‘Mykonos’ and are matched with smart skirting and original floorboards painted with Farrow & Ball’s ‘Skimming Stone’. The front of the room allows for a dining table, set next to the fireplace, while the kitchen is arranged to the rear. American walnut worktops flank a full-height aluminium door that leads to the terrace outside, and the kitchen is fitted with appliances by Rangemaster.  Stairs lead down from this level to a second large living space, currently arranged as a sung. There are huge bespoke storage spaces by InJoinery, and this room has a comforting sense of seclusion. Here, Farrow & Ball’s ‘Setting Plaster’ complements a new hessian carpet, and the lower-ground floor gives access to the neat rear courtyard garden. There is also a family bathroom on this level, meaning that the rooms are perfectly arranged for use as a guest suite or home office.  There are two bedrooms on the first floor, both dressed minimally around exposed fireplaces. The smaller of the two has a cast-iron radiator. This house has been carefully laid out with bathrooms on three of its levels. On this floor, a family shower room is positioned between the bedrooms.  The loft bedroom was added to the plan as part of a complete renovation in 2021. Conceived as the main suite, it has Velux windows and a large built-in desk/dressing table with sweet linen curtains underneath. The adjacent bathroom has unlacquered brass taps, porcelain tiles and a freestanding bath that allows the space elegance and function above its size.  Outdoor Space  A sliding door opens from the lower-ground reception room to the courtyard garden, laid with brick. From here, a back gate opens onto common land beyond, which bursts into flower in the summer with wildflowers. A decked terrace leads from the kitchen and dining area and has views of the common land, the courtyard garden and verdant tree canopies.  The Area  Hackney Wick lies between Victoria Park and the River Lee. Once a bustling industrial area, its green spaces and easy access to the best of east London it has drawn an eclectic and creative crowd. Since the 2012 Olympics, it has seen a significant influx of cultural investment, with new developments and facilities in easy reach of this house. There are numerous restaurants and bars, including the Michelin-starred Cornerstone, as well as Silo and Crate Brewery.  The Here East campus with F45, The Breakfast Club, Randy’s Wings, Mother and Gotto is a short walk away and operates as a co-working hub and cultural centre, while award-winning theatre and music venue The Yard is also close by.  The amenities of the Olympic Park are close at hand, where the East Bank, a new world-class cultural quarter, is now under construction, with new facilities for the V&A Museum, Sadler’s Wells Theatre, the BBC and the London College of Fashion, as well as a new campus for UCL.  Victoria Park is a short walk away and is surrounded by a number of good pubs. On the north side of the park is Victoria Park Village, with its excellent range of restaurants and shops, including The Ginger Pig butchers, Bottle Apostle and Jonathan Norris Fishmongers.  The house is a seven-minute walk from Hackney Wick station, which runs London Overground services to Highbury & Islington in around 10 minutes and Stratford International in approximately six minutes.

Safeguarding Your Information Important information regarding cybercrime. It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet, or PC, maybe by sending out a random email that mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine. The reason for us mentioning this to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g. just before the exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears. Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond the property. Solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information.

We can -- and often do -- choose to invest in only the biggest and most reputable establishments. When you are investing in a globally recognised brand, further, into an established hotel under an established brand, you can see why it would be a low-risk investment.  Hands-Free Investment   Hotel rooms are the perfect investment. You choose a hotel that is performing well from a number of hotel investment companies, you invest in a room (or rooms) and sit back and collect the income. Normally when you read things like that it is too good to be true, but not in this.  Your room becomes part of the hotel stock, it is serviced and managed as part of the hotel, and you get a share of the hotel income, either they take a percentage of the income from your room, or you take a percentage of the overall hotel income.   Depending on the term of the investment there are usually incremental refurbishments, again, this is simply because your room is taken care of with the rest of the hotel. You even get some free usage thrown in.  Guaranteed Rental Yield   Many hotel investment deals come with a guaranteed rental yield. This takes another layer of risk away from the investment and makes a calculating return on investment easy.     All pictures shown are for illustration purposes only  Contact Us Today for a Free Consultation< /b>",2022-06-26 13:04:28

With Shared Ownership, you buy a share of your home using a mortgage from a bank or building society and pay a subsidised rent on the share you did not purchase. The combined mortgage and rent is usually less than you’d expect to pay if you bought a similar property outright. At Junction West you can buy a minimum 25% share of your home (the maximum you can buy initially is 75%). When you’re ready, you can buy more shares until you staircase to owning 100% of your home. To be eligible for this shared ownership scheme you would need to meet the following criteria: • Your household income does not exceed £90,000 • You have a deposit of at least 5% of the share value • You do not own another property or have your name on the deeds or a mortgage for a property worldwide.  • This will be your only residence. • You are a permanent UK resident or have indefinite right to remain. Please note the minimum share you can purchase can vary depending on your financial situation and you may be asked to purchase a larger share, should your personal circumstances permit. *Service charges are estimated and may subject to change. **These photos are for information purposes only and may not represent a true likeness for the units being sold.

You buy the financial share that works for your budget and pay a low monthly fee to us for the bit you haven't bought. You need a smaller deposit, as it's based on the price of the share you buy, rather than the full value. And, just like owning outright, when you want to move on you simply sell your share for its market value at that time. Or, when you're ready, you can buy more shares...until it's all yours.   You can initially buy between 25-75%, according to what you can afford. Some round-number examples, based on a home with a full market value of £480,000:  30% share = £144,000 (Your 5% deposit would be £7,200; your monthly mortgage £634* and your monthly fee £770 = £1404/month) 40% share = £192,000 (Your 5% deposit would be £9,600; your monthly mortgage £845* and your monthly fee £660 = £1505/month) 50% share = £240,000 (Your 5% deposit would be £12,000; your monthly mortgage £1056* and your monthly fee £550 = £1606/month) 60% share = £288,000 (Your 5% deposit would be £14,400; your monthly mortgage £1267* and your monthly fee £440 = £1707/month)  It really works, with hundreds of thousands of people across the country having already bought their home this way.  Our experienced, professional team is here to ensure that things go as smoothly as possible.

CBRE's 2018 Market Outlook expects the UK property sector to continue to perform solidly with the so-called ""beds sector"" which includes hotels, weathering any uncertainty well.   This sentiment is echoed by Colliers International who views hotels as an ""attractive and popular"" investment opportunity despite Brexit uncertainty. A weaker sterling is expected to attract even more international buyers to UK hotels over the next 12 months, especially those located in the provinces, over the next 12 months.   Key Benefits   *	High Rental Yields & Strong Capital Growth  *	Completely Passive & Fully Managed  *	Consistently Successful Property Sector  Hotel investments are totally hands-free, easy to calculate for tax purposes and can even be added to a SIPP for an extra layer of tax relief.  All pictures shown are for illustration purposes only  Contact Us Today for a Free Consultation< /b>",2022-06-22 20:18:33
