You will usually pay a mortgage on the part you own and a subsidised rent on the part you don't own. As your income rises, you can increase the share you own until you eventually own 100%. ;;; ;;;*Household incomes are based on joint applications. Single applications are able to apply but may need to increase their deposit contribution to meet shared ownership affordability requirements. ;;; ;;; **Viewings **;;;For those who would like to and are able to visit us, the Show Home is now open on an appointment-only basis, with extra measures in place to ensure your wellbeing.

The careful, sympathetic restoration has maintained the original character and proportions of the building, while creating functional and flexible apartments. The result is an elegant, contemporary home with a natural, calming palette and considered design details. ;;; ;;;This bright and airy apartment is accessed via a light- filled communal stairwell. Once inside, you will find the two double bedrooms to your right, a large double-spaced living area to your left and the bathroom directly ahead. The original restored hardwood floorboards run from the hallway throughout the entire flat, and each room benefits from a sash window. ;;; ;;;The kitchen and living area are separated by concealed sliding doors, which can be closed to zone off the two individual rooms, or left open to create a generously proportioned open plan space. Both sides of the open plan living area benefit from their own sash windows, affording each section its own source of natural light. ;;; ;;;The kitchen itself is made up of bespoke, custom-built plywood cabinetry and built-in alcove shelving. Both bedrooms are large enough for double beds, and the bathroom features a freestanding clawfoot soaking tub with an overhead rain shower. ;;; ;;;The details of this well-designed flat have been carefully considered and executed. The restored floorboards - sanded with lye and white matt oil - keep the palette natural and warm. The serene, calming Little Greene paint brings warmth to the light that reaches every corner. And the striking porcelain light switches add a pleasing tactility throughout. ;;; ;;;Wisteria Road is just down the road from Hither Green village, for local cafes and boutique shops. Lewisham town centre is a short walk away and is currently undergoing a huge redevelopment; Phase one of the Lewisham Gateway project, where the DLR, mainline and bus stations conjoin, has been completed, and Phase two (the final phase) is underway. The new leisure facilities here will include a gym and multiplex cinema. ;;; ;;;You'll also find the famous Sparrow Restaurant close by, which featured in the 2021 Michelin Guide. Blackheath is reachable by foot and plays host to summer concerts and festivals. On the other side of the heath you reach the top of Greenwich Park.

Positioned perfectly for West Norwood high street with an array of shops, restaurants, and leisure facilities as well as being just 0.5 miles from Gipsy Hill station, 0.7 miles from West Norwood station, and 0.7 miles from Sydenham Hill station all giving commuters direct access into central London (distance estimated via Google Maps).;;;;;;Council Tax Band D £1660;;;Freehold;;;;;;The vendor has provided the above information in good faith. Galloways have not yet had this information verified. Any buyer should seek their own independent legal advice before proceeding.;;;;;;Safeguarding Your Information;;;Important information regarding cybercrime. It has come to our attention that computer hackers are seeking to target property transactions to access funds. As we understand it, they will either hack a phone, tablet, or PC, maybe by sending out a random email that mistakenly gets opened, or even whilst opening a website, which gives them access to that machine. The reason for us mentioning this to you is to alert you that once they have gained access, they can monitor email correspondence, without you knowing, throughout a transaction. Then, at a relevant point, e.g. just before the exchange of contracts, they can send an email to a client mirroring that of their solicitor asking for funds to be transferred to a certain bank account. That money then, of course, disappears. Fortunately, we have not had such an instance but, feel it important to highlight the fact that if you do receive an email requesting funds, it is worth checking with the person concerned by phone that it is genuine and the bank details are correct, before sending money. This could, of course, affect other areas of finance beyond the property. Solicitors are starting to highlight this point now, but for safety, we would urge you to be vigilant and check before sending money or passing on any personal details regarding any bank or credit card information.;;;;;;The Property Misdescriptions Act 1991;;;These particulars are set out as a general outline in accordance with the Property Misdescriptions Act (1991) only for the guidance of intending purchasers or lessees and do not constitute any part of an offer or contract. Details are given without any responsibility, and any intending purchasers, lessees or third parties should not rely on them as statements or representations of fact but must satisfy themselves by inspection or otherwise as to the correctness of each of them. We have not carried out a structural survey and the services, appliances and specific fittings have not been tested. All photographs, measurements, floor plans, and distances referred to are given as a guide only and should not be relied upon for the purchase of carpets or any other fixtures or fittings. Gardens, roof terraces, balconies as well as tenure and lease details cannot have their accuracy guaranteed for intending purchasers. Lease details, service charge, ground rent are given as a guide only and should be checked and confirmed by your solicitor.

Parkleys was the first project by SPAN co-founders Eric Lyons and Geoff Townsend and is one of London’s finest residential modernist estates. It is set among beautiful communal gardens planted with flowering trees, and expansive stretches of lawn that are much loved by residents. The estate is located in leafy Ham, a pretty suburb with a lovely high street, which sits between Richmond Park and the River Thames in south London. ;;; ;;;The Architect ;;; ;;;SPAN are perhaps the most celebrated of all 20th-century British residential developers. Many of the developments that they worked on throughout the south of England are now listed, and they are renowned for their outstanding, yet simple, modern architectural style and their considered landscaping. For more information, please see the History section below. ;;; ;;;The Tour ;;; ;;;The apartment is on the second floor of Herrick Court. Entry is to a short hallway, with plenty of storage, leading through to the main living spaces. Full width wooden framed windows stretch across the living room offering a panorama of the luscious treetops that ensconce the estate. The current owners have reinstated certain SPAN features, including a beautiful glass partition between the kitchen and living space, and the tiled hearth surrounding the newly installed wood burning stove. Engineered oak floorboards run throughout the apartment and all the windows have been fitted with English Heritage double glazing. ;;; ;;;The kitchen sits at the back of the plan overlooking the communal gardens. Ply cabinetry is finished with a Corian worktop and a white tiled splashback, establishing a fresh and contemporary feel. Bespoke shelving lines the left-hand wall above the dining area maximising storage space. ;;; ;;;An archway leads through to the bedrooms and bathrooms framed by a beautifully crafted wooden surround; a hallmark of the attention to detail exercised throughout the apartment. The main bedroom sits at the front of the plan with treetop views. Original built-in wardrobes and corner shelving provide plenty of storage in this generously proportioned room. ;;; ;;;The second bedroom has a dual aspect, its windows wrapping round the corner of the building, the immediacy of the gardens and tree tops never out of view. The adjacent bathroom has a cream rubber floor, Johnson tiles, and Lusso matt black fixtures and fittings. This is a sympathetic update to the SPAN aesthetic. There is a deep corner cupboard at the end of the hallway. ;;; ;;;The communal areas and landing are of particular note in this estate; they have been impeccably executed with decorative brick, glass and bespoke SPAN details that have been lovingly maintained. Each apartment has a private external store and there are communal drying and bike storage rooms. ;;; ;;;Outdoor space ;;; ;;;Parkleys, like many SPAN schemes, is renowned for its expansive communal gardens that wrap around the estate. Mature flowering trees give the area a woodland feel whilst the lawns give all resident access to generous outdoor space. ;;; ;;;The Area ;;; ;;;Ham is a picturesque district in southwest London located between Richmond upon Thames and Kingston upon Thames. It unfurls around a large, open common and is renowned for the quality of its period architecture, the most notable example of which is Ham House, described by the National Trust as “the most complete survival of 17th-century fashion and power”. ;;; ;;;Ham Common woods nature reserve is a five minute walk away and runs towards the expanse of Richmond Park beyond. There is a parade of shops in Ham, including a monthly farmers’ market plus wider shopping and dining opportunities in Richmond and Kingston. ;;; ;;;Richmond and Kingston both have fast train connections into central London. ;;; ;;;Tenure: Share of Freehold ;;;Lease Length: approx. 959 years remaining ;;;Service Charge: approx. £2,400 per annum ;;;Parking: There is unallocated residents parking in the estate ;;;Council Tax Band: D  ",2 bedroom flat,Check out this 2 bedroom flat for sale on ,"2 bedroom flat for sale in Herrick Court, Parkleys, London TW10 for £450,000.
